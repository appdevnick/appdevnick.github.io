Hi, I'm Nick, and I'm writing down what I learn about Linux, the kernel, and maybe embedded systems at some later date.

## This site is guaranteed to contain mistakes, errors and bad ideas that I will try to correct over time as I learn. 

That's the reality of being a "newbie" who is documenting his learning process, of course, but I just wanted to make that clear from the outset. 

I'm maintaining this site primarily for my own development as an aspiring Linux/embedded developer. I'm keeping fairly extensive notes in Obsidian, and sometimes I will want to expand on those notes because I'm trying to piece together how something works. I might also want to document projects that I build while learning.

I hope it's apparent that some of what I write is going to be very naive or just plain wrong. As of October 2024, I consider myself an "enthusiastic beginner."

**I think there are broadly two groups of people who might be interested:**

1. novices like myself who might want to compare notes. 
2. people with experience and who likely have corrections or additional resources

Either way, I would like to hear from you if you ever have questions, concerns, corrections, or comments.
