## Documenting my learning

This blog exists for the purpose of writing down the things that I learn about Linux, the kernel, embedded, and general electronics.

I've discovered a passion for lower-level computing problems, and the world of Linux is a target-rich environment for that kind of learning :)

My goal is to transfer over from a short stint in web development into Linux kernel programming and embedded electronics.
