## Where I've been

I went to law school and passed the Indiana bar, but that was in 2008 when the economy was pretty bad, so employment dried up just as I was starting the job search. 

Stymied by the legal market, I move on to running a couple of online businesses, eventually selling them. 

Soon after, my interest in programming was reignited and I spent a few years working in web development, lucky to contract with a company full of great people with great products. Unfortunately, pandemic economics meant it was time to find a new position after a short time. 

2019 was a time where plenty of people decided to upskill in some way. Now unemployed, my own upskilling time had come as well. I wanted to challenge myself beyond what I had worked on before. I am increasingly curious and passionate about the lower level technologies that power our operating systems and devices, so this seemed like a logical area of study.

Prior to this, I was exclusively a terminal-phobic Windows user, proficient enough with writing code and getting it deployed, but far from an OS power user. Diving in head-first to Linux for the first time was an intense but very fulfilling experience:

1. I learned how to install Linux alongside Windows
2. Then I learned basic command-line functions and utilities, but...
3. perhaps more importantly, I learned a lot about the philosophy behind Linux, **specifically with regard to composing lots of tiny utilities together to achieve a target result.**
4. the even bigger realization was just how sophisticated the kernel must be in order to manage all of this!

## Where I'm at now

I have used Linux exclusively for a few years now. I've written code in C, Elixir, Javascript/Typescript, and even a little Rust while in web-related roles. I've also been reading as much as I can get my hands on about kernel internals along with getting an STM32 Nucleo board to start fiddling with. At the time of this writing, I'm just getting started with poking at registers and making LEDs blink, which is un-ironically exciting to get working for the first time.

## Where I'm headed

After whetting my appetite with Linux and programming for a few years now, I want to dive deeper and learn about the kernel. I have also developed an interest in embedded software and hardware along with basic electronics, so there may be posts along those lines from time to time. Ultimately, I hope to obtain employment in a related field.

## One last time for effect!

Please do not mistake anything on this site for any kind of **authority** on the kernel, embedded systems, or anything else in life. I will strive for correctness, though.
